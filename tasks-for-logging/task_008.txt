# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement scheduler dummy break logging (FEAT-LOG-005 part 2)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add logging for generated dummy break items and constraints in the scheduler.
# Details:
In apps/scheduler/src/scheduler/payload.ts, add DEBUG level logging for the generated dummy break items and their associated fixed constraints. Log each dummy break's ID, associated technician, and fixed time. This will help verify that gaps are correctly translated into dummy breaks with appropriate constraints.

# Test Strategy:
Test with scenarios containing availability gaps and verify logs show the correct dummy breaks being generated with appropriate fixed times matching the identified gaps.
