# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement optimizer solver status logging (FEAT-LOG-003)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Add logging for the raw status code returned by the OR-Tools solver.
# Details:
Locate the code section where routing.SolveWithParameters() is called in the optimizer. Immediately after this call, add INFO level logging that captures the integer status code returned by routing.status(). Include a mapping of common status codes to their meanings (e.g., 0=ROUTING_SUCCESS, 1=ROUTING_FAIL, etc.) to make logs more interpretable. This should provide more specific failure reasons beyond the application's mapped error/no solution status.

# Test Strategy:
Create test cases that trigger different solver outcomes (success, infeasible, fail) and verify the raw status codes are correctly logged with appropriate context.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Locate and analyze the routing.SolveWithParameters() call [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify the exact location in the codebase where routing.SolveWithParameters() is called and understand the current implementation context.
### Details:
Search the codebase for the routing.SolveWithParameters() method call in the optimizer component. Analyze the surrounding code to understand how the solver is currently being used and how status codes are currently handled. Identify the variable that stores the routing status after the solve operation. Document the file path, class name, and method name where this call exists for reference in subsequent subtasks.

## 2. Research and create a mapping of OR-Tools status codes to descriptive messages [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive mapping between the integer status codes returned by routing.status() and their human-readable meanings.
### Details:
Research the OR-Tools documentation to identify all possible status codes that can be returned by the routing solver. Based on the search results, the CP-SAT solver has status codes like OPTIMAL and FEASIBLE that need to be mapped. Create a static mapping (either as a constant dictionary/map or an enum) that translates each integer status code to a descriptive string (e.g., 0='ROUTING_SUCCESS', 1='ROUTING_FAIL'). Include all possible status codes that might be returned in your application context. This mapping will be used in the logging implementation.

## 3. Implement INFO level logging for solver status [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Add logging code that captures and logs the raw integer status code immediately after the routing.SolveWithParameters() call.
### Details:
Modify the code to add an INFO level log statement immediately after the routing.SolveWithParameters() call. The log should capture the raw integer status code returned by routing.status(). Use the mapping created in subtask 2 to include both the raw status code and its descriptive meaning in the log message. Format the log message to be clear and consistent with existing logging patterns in the codebase. Example log format: 'Optimizer solver status: 0 (ROUTING_SUCCESS)' or 'Optimizer solver status: 1 (ROUTING_FAIL)'.

## 4. Test and verify the status logging implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Test the logging implementation with various solver scenarios to ensure all status codes are correctly logged and interpreted.
### Details:
Create test cases that trigger different solver outcomes to verify that the status logging works correctly for all possible status codes. Test both successful and failed optimization scenarios. Verify that the logs contain both the raw status code and the correct descriptive message. Ensure that the logging doesn't interfere with the normal operation of the optimizer. Update any relevant documentation to include information about the new logging feature and how to interpret the status codes in the logs.
