# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement scheduler orchestration target date logging (FEAT-LOG-006 part 1)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Add logging for the target date at the start of each overflow pass in the scheduler orchestration.
# Details:
In apps/scheduler/src/scheduler/orchestrator.ts, add INFO level logging at the beginning of each iteration in the runFullReplan overflow loop. Log the targetDate being processed in each pass. This will provide a clear trace of the multi-day planning process sequence.

# Test Strategy:
Run multi-day planning scenarios and verify logs show the correct sequence of target dates being processed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify overflow loop and targetDate variable in orchestrator [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Locate the runFullReplan overflow loop in apps/scheduler/src/scheduler/orchestrator.ts and determine where each iteration begins and how the targetDate is referenced.
### Details:
Open orchestrator.ts and search for the runFullReplan function. Identify the loop that handles overflow passes. Confirm the variable representing the target date for each pass and note the exact start of each iteration.

## 2. Determine and prepare the logging mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Review the existing logging approach in the codebase and ensure an INFO-level logger is available for use in orchestrator.ts.
### Details:
Check if a logging library (e.g., Winston, Pino, or a custom logger) is already used in the project. If not, consider implementing a simple logger or using console.info as a fallback. Ensure the logger supports structured logging and INFO level messages, following best practices for clarity and consistency[1][4][5].

## 3. Implement INFO-level logging at the start of each overflow pass [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Add an INFO-level log statement at the beginning of each iteration in the overflow loop, clearly indicating the targetDate being processed.
### Details:
Insert the logging statement at the identified location in the loop. The log message should include the targetDate and context about the overflow pass. Use structured logging if possible, e.g., logger.info('Starting overflow pass', { targetDate }). Ensure the log message is descriptive and follows the project's logging format[1][2][5].

## 4. Test and verify logging output [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Run the scheduler orchestration to confirm that INFO-level logs are generated at the correct points and contain the expected targetDate information.
### Details:
Execute relevant test cases or manually trigger the runFullReplan process. Check the logs to ensure each overflow pass logs the targetDate at the INFO level. Adjust the log message or placement if necessary for clarity and completeness.
