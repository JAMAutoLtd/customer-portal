# Status: done

# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up Playwright configuration for UI testing
# Details:
Create and configure Playwright for E2E testing:
1. Create `tests/e2e/playwright.config.ts` that:
   - Reads base URL from environment variables (E2E_BASE_URL)
   - Configures browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
   - Sets up screenshot and video capture on failure
   - Configures timeouts and retry settings
   - Sets up test reporting
2. Create basic Page Object Models (POM) structure in `tests/e2e/pages/`
3. Set up helper utilities for common UI interactions
4. Configure npm scripts for running Playwright tests (`test:e2e:run`)

Ensure the configuration supports running tests against the locally running web service.

# Test Strategy:
Create a simple test that loads the application homepage and verify that Playwright can run it successfully with the configuration. Check that environment variables are correctly read and applied.
