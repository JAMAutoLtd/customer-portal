# Task ID: 13
# Title: Set up Docker Compose configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create Docker Compose configuration for local service execution
# Details:
Create and configure `docker-compose.test.yml` that:
1. Defines services for web, scheduler, and optimiser
2. Configures each service to use the appropriate environment variables
3. Sets up networking between services
4. Configures volume mounts for code and data
5. Sets up health checks for service readiness

Ensure the configuration allows services to connect to the Staging Supabase instance via environment variables in .env.test.

# Test Strategy:
Test starting and stopping the Docker services using the configuration. Verify that all services start correctly and can communicate with each other and with the Staging Supabase instance.
