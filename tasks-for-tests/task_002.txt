# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Supabase client utility
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a utility function to establish connections to the Staging Supabase instance
# Details:
Create a utility function `createStagingSupabaseClient` that:
1. Reads Supabase credentials from .env.test file
2. Establishes a connection to the Staging Supabase instance
3. Handles authentication with service role key
4. Provides error handling for connection issues
5. Returns a properly typed Supabase client instance
6. Includes optional parameter for admin access (for auth operations)

Implement in a file like `simulation/utils/supabase-client.ts`

# Test Strategy:
Create a simple test script that uses the utility to connect to Supabase and perform a basic query. Verify connection is established correctly and credentials are properly read from environment variables.
