# Description: Set up Jest configuration for backend integration testing
# Details:
Create and configure Jest for integration testing:
1. Create `tests/integration/jest.config.integration.js` that:
   - Configures TypeScript support (ts-jest)
   - Sets up environment variable loading from .env.test
   - Configures test timeouts for async operations
   - Sets up test reporting
2. Create helper utilities for interacting with the scheduler API
3. Set up utilities for querying the Supabase database
4. Configure npm scripts for running Jest tests (`test:integration`)

Ensure the configuration supports testing against the locally running scheduler service.

# Test Strategy:
Create a simple test that makes a basic API call to the scheduler service and verify that Jest can run it successfully with the configuration. Check that environment variables are correctly loaded.
