# Task ID: 15
# Title: Create comprehensive documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Document the E2E testing framework and its usage
# Details:
Create comprehensive documentation for the E2E testing framework:
1. README.md with overview, setup instructions, and usage examples
2. Documentation for each component:
   - Environment setup
   - Database management
   - Test execution
   - CLI runner
   - Migration utility
   - Technician data handling (including the separation into `technician-data.ts`)
   - The `--techs` parameter: purpose, usage flow, and examples in scenario seeding
3. Troubleshooting guide
4. Examples of extending the framework with new scenarios
5. Best practices for writing tests
6. Detailed explanation of recent refactoring:
   - Separation of technician definitions into `technician-data.ts`
   - Removal of technician handling from `seedBaseline`
   - Updated logic in `seedScenarioTechnicians`
   - Modified behavior of `cleanupScenarioLeftovers`
   - Updated scenario seeding architecture in `seed/index.ts`:
     - How it now handles technician seeding for scenarios
     - How it passes technicianDbIds down to specific scripts
     - How these IDs are included in the output metadata
     - Important note that scenario scripts must not seed technicians internally

Ensure the documentation is clear, concise, and includes examples for all major operations.

# Test Strategy:
Review the documentation for completeness and accuracy. Have another team member follow the documentation to set up and use the framework, noting any unclear or missing information. Specifically verify that the technician data handling documentation accurately reflects the recent refactoring and that the documentation for the `--techs` parameter clearly explains its purpose and usage in scenario seeding. Ensure the documentation clearly explains the updated scenario seeding architecture in seed/index.ts, including the technician seeding flow and the requirement that scenario scripts must not seed technicians internally.
