# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement main seeding entry point
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a main script to orchestrate baseline and scenario seeding
# Details:
Implement the main seeding script (`simulation/scripts/db/seed/index.ts`) that:
1. Parses CLI arguments to determine action (baseline or scenario)
2. For baseline seeding, calls the baseline script with the specified technician count
3. For scenario seeding, runs baseline first, then the specified scenario script
4. Generates a `seed-metadata.json` file containing:
   - Timestamp of the seed run
   - Counts of created entities
   - IDs of created records
   - Scenario name (if applicable)
5. Handles errors gracefully
6. Provides detailed logging of the seeding process

Ensure the script can be run via `pnpm db:seed:staging -- --action [baseline|scenario] --scenario [name] --techCount [1-4]`

# Test Strategy:
Test the script with various combinations of arguments. Verify that the correct seeding actions are performed and that the seed-metadata.json file is generated correctly with all required information.
