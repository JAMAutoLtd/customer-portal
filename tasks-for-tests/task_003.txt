# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement database cleanup script
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a script to clean test data from the Staging database
# Details:
Implement the cleanup script (`simulation/scripts/db/cleanup-staging.ts`) that:
1. Uses the Supabase client utility to connect to Staging
2. Identifies test data based on defined patterns (email domain, notes prefix)
3. Implements multiple confirmation prompts before executing deletions
4. Deletes data in the correct order to respect foreign key constraints
5. Uses Supabase Admin API to delete auth.users
6. Handles errors gracefully
7. Provides detailed logging of the cleanup process

Ensure the script can be run independently via `pnpm db:clean:staging`

# Test Strategy:
Test the script against a staging database with known test data. Verify all test data is removed and no errors occur due to foreign key constraints. Confirm that confirmation prompts work correctly.
