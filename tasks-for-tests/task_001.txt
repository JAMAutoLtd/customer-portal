# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up project dependencies and configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project structure and install all required dependencies for the E2E testing framework
# Details:
Create the project structure and install dependencies using pnpm:
1. Initialize pnpm workspace in the root directory
2. Install core dependencies: Node.js, TypeScript, Playwright, Jest, Supabase client, Inquirer, Faker, Dotenv
3. Create the basic folder structure for the framework:
   - simulation/scripts/db/seed/
   - simulation/scripts/db/seed/scenarios/
   - tests/e2e/specs/
   - tests/integration/scheduler/
4. Set up TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
5. Create initial .env.test template with required environment variables
6. Set up docker-compose.test.yml for local service execution

# Test Strategy:
Verify all dependencies are correctly installed by running `pnpm list`. Ensure the project structure is created correctly. Test that TypeScript compilation works with a simple test file.
