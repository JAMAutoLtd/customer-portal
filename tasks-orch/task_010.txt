# Description: Add comprehensive comments and documentation for the new availability pre-check logic.
# Details:
Add clear comments explaining the purpose and functionality of the new availability pre-check logic.

Update any existing comments that might be affected by the changes. Follow the existing commenting style in the file for consistency.
