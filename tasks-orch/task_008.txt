# Task ID: 8
# Title: Add logging for overflow pass availability checks
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement clear logging messages for the overflow pass availability check process and outcomes.
# Details:
Add informative log messages at key points in the overflow pass availability check process: 1) When starting the availability check for each overflow day (include the date), 2) When determining no technicians are available for a specific date, 3) When updating job states due to no availability, and 4) For each job that is updated with a transient failure. Use the existing logging mechanism in the orchestrator file for consistency. Ensure log levels are appropriate (info for general flow, warn for no availability, debug for detailed job updates).

# Test Strategy:
Review logs in test scenarios to verify that messages are clear, informative, and appear at the appropriate points in the execution flow for overflow passes.
