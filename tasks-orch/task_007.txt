# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement job state update logic when skipping overflow passes
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Add logic to update job states when an overflow pass is skipped due to no technician availability.
# Details:
Inside the `if (!isAnyTechAvailable)` block for overflow passes, iterate through the `jobStates` map. For each job in a `pending` or `failed_transient` state, add a new `SchedulingAttempt` to the job's state indicating failure for the `currentPlanningDate` with `FailureReason.NO_TECHNICIAN_AVAILABILITY`. Update the job's `lastStatus` to `failed_transient`. Include clear logging messages indicating that the overflow pass was skipped due to no technician availability for the specific date. Ensure the block ends with a `continue` statement to move to the next overflow day.

# Test Strategy:
Test with mock job states to verify that jobs are correctly updated with the appropriate failure reason and status when an overflow pass is skipped. Check logs to ensure clear messaging about the skipped overflow pass.
