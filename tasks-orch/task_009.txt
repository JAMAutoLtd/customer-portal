# Task ID: 9
# Title: Refactor and optimize the implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Review the implementation for potential code duplication and optimize where possible.
# Details:
Review the implemented availability check logic for Pass 1 and overflow passes to identify any code duplication. Consider extracting common functionality into helper methods, such as a `checkTechnicianAvailability` function that takes a list of technicians, a date, and optional locked jobs, and returns a boolean indicating if any technician has availability. Similarly, consider extracting the job state update logic into a reusable function. Ensure any refactoring maintains the correct behavior and doesn't introduce new issues.

# Test Strategy:
After refactoring, retest all scenarios to ensure the behavior remains consistent. Verify that both Pass 1 and overflow passes still correctly identify days with no availability and update job states appropriately.
