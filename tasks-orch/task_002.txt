# Task ID: 2
# Title: Add necessary imports for availability checking
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure all required types and functions for availability checking are properly imported in the orchestrator.ts file.
# Details:
Add or verify imports for `TimeWindow`, `applyLockedJobsToWindows`, and `DailyAvailabilityWindows` from `./availability`. Also ensure that `FailureReason.NO_TECHNICIAN_AVAILABILITY` is properly imported from the appropriate enum file. Check if any other imports are needed for the implementation of the pre-check logic.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all imports resolve correctly without TypeScript errors. Ensure that the imported types and functions match the expected signatures.
