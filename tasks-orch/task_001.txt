# Task ID: 1
# Title: Analyze orchestrator.ts structure and identify modification points
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Review the current structure of the orchestrator.ts file to understand the flow and identify the exact points where availability pre-checks need to be inserted.
# Details:
Examine the `runFullReplan` function in `apps/scheduler/src/scheduler/orchestrator.ts`. Identify the section that handles Pass 1 (Today) planning and the while loop that handles overflow passes. Note the existing logic flow, variable names, and function calls. Pay special attention to how technician availability is currently calculated and how job states are managed. Document the exact line numbers or code blocks where modifications will be needed.

# Test Strategy:
Create a detailed map of the function structure with insertion points clearly marked. Validate understanding by tracing through the existing code flow for both Pass 1 and overflow passes.
