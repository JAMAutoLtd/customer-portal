# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement job state update logic when skipping Pass 1
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Add logic to update job states when Pass 1 is skipped due to no technician availability.
# Details:
Add an `else` block after the modified main `if` condition for when `!isAnyTechAvailableToday`. In this block, iterate through the `jobStates` map. For each job in a `pending` or `failed_transient` state, add a new `SchedulingAttempt` to the job's state indicating failure for today's date with `FailureReason.NO_TECHNICIAN_AVAILABILITY`. Update the job's `lastStatus` to `failed_transient`. Include clear logging messages indicating that Pass 1 was skipped due to no technician availability.

# Test Strategy:
Test with mock job states to verify that jobs are correctly updated with the appropriate failure reason and status. Check logs to ensure clear messaging about the skipped pass.
