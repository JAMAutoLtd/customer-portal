      "taskTitle": "Create Unified Equipment Requirements Table Schema",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of creating the unified equipment_requirements table schema into subtasks such as: (1) Drafting the schema SQL, (2) Reviewing and validating constraints and indexes, (3) Applying the schema to development and test environments, (4) Verifying table creation and permissions.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard database schema design and implementation, including constraints and indexes. While not trivial, it is a common operation for experienced developers and DBAs, and can be decomposed into a few clear steps."

      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks: (1) Analyze source and target schemas, (2) Write migration SQL for each legacy table, (3) Implement conflict handling, (4) Write cleanup script, (5) Test migration on staging data, (6) Validate data integrity post-migration.",
      "reasoning": "Data migration requires careful mapping, conflict handling, and validation to avoid data loss or corruption, making it more complex than schema changes alone."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Set up test file and mocks, (2) Write tests for specific requirements, (3) Write tests for fallback logic, (4) Ensure coverage for edge cases.",
      "reasoning": "Unit testing is a standard practice, but comprehensive coverage and mocking database responses adds moderate complexity."
