      "taskTitle": "Refactor Technician Data Retrieval and Availability Calculation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of refactoring technician data retrieval and availability calculation into 5 subtasks, focusing on database schema updates, API modifications, interface changes, calculation logic refactoring, and handling of locked jobs separately.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves significant changes to core data structures and algorithms. It requires modifying database queries, updating TypeScript interfaces, and completely rewriting availability calculation logic to handle multiple time windows and locked jobs. The high complexity comes from the need to maintain data integrity while fundamentally changing how availability is calculated."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Availability Gap Modeling for Optimizer",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the implementation of availability gap modeling into 4 subtasks, covering identification of unavailability periods, creation of dummy break items, generation of fixed constraints, and integration with the existing optimizer payload structure.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires creating new logic to model unavailable periods as constraints. It involves understanding the existing optimization payload structure, identifying gaps in availability, and generating appropriate constraints. The complexity comes from ensuring the optimizer correctly respects these constraints while maintaining overall scheduling efficiency."

      "taskTitle": "Enhance Fixed Time Job Handling for Multi-Day Planning",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the enhancement of fixed time job handling into 4 subtasks, focusing on date comparison logic, constraint generation for specific days, overflow planning loop modifications, and testing with various date scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires modifying the orchestrator to correctly handle fixed time jobs across multiple planning days. The complexity comes from ensuring that jobs are included in the correct day's constraints and that this behavior is consistent across overflow planning passes. It requires careful date handling and understanding of the existing orchestration flow."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement State Management for Unschedulable Jobs",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the implementation of state management for unschedulable jobs into 5 subtasks, covering job attempt tracking, failure reason categorization, persistent vs. transient failure detection, overflow loop filtering, and detailed reporting enhancements.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a sophisticated state management system to track job scheduling attempts and differentiate between different types of scheduling failures. The complexity comes from the need to maintain state across multiple planning passes and implement logic to categorize failure reasons accurately."

      "taskTitle": "Optimize Travel Time Calculation with Bulk API Requests",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the travel time calculation optimization into 4 subtasks, focusing on origin-destination pair collection, bulk API request implementation, response handling and mapping, and caching mechanism development.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires refactoring the travel time calculation to use bulk API requests instead of individual ones. The complexity comes from collecting all required pairs, making efficient bulk requests, handling the responses correctly, and implementing caching to reduce API calls. It requires understanding of the Google Maps API and careful optimization."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Predictive Traffic for Future Planning Days",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the implementation of predictive traffic for future planning days into 4 subtasks, covering API parameter modifications, departure time calculation for future days, integration with the payload generation process, and testing with various time scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task builds on the previous travel time optimization to incorporate predictive traffic data. The complexity is moderate as it primarily involves adding departure time parameters to existing API calls and ensuring they're calculated correctly for future planning days."

      "taskTitle": "Enhance Job Bundling and Eligibility Determination",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the enhancement of job bundling and eligibility determination into 5 subtasks, focusing on order-based bundling logic, equipment-based eligibility checks, van assignment handling, bundle breaking conditions, and failure reason reporting improvements.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves refactoring complex business logic for job bundling and technician eligibility. The complexity comes from handling various scenarios like equipment requirements and van assignments, implementing logic to break bundles when necessary, and providing detailed failure reporting."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Logging System",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the implementation of the comprehensive logging system into 4 subtasks, covering core logging infrastructure, technician schedule logging, unscheduled job reporting, and summary log generation with Google Maps links.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing logging throughout the codebase to capture key information. While it touches many parts of the system, the actual changes are relatively straightforward, focusing on adding logging statements at key points and ensuring they provide useful information."

      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing logic to perform a bulk database update after all planning passes. The complexity comes from ensuring that different types of jobs (scheduled, unschedulable) are updated correctly, and that the update is performed as a single transaction for reliability."
