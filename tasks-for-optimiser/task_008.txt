# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Logging System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a comprehensive logging system that captures key steps, decisions, warnings, and errors throughout the orchestration process.
# Details:
Implement logging throughout the codebase to capture key information as specified in FR-SCHED-014. Log the final schedule details for each technician, the list of jobs remaining in `pending_review` after all passes, and specific reasons why jobs were left unscheduled. Generate a final summary log including schedules, van equipment, unschedulable jobs, and Google Maps direction links. Ensure logs are clear, informative, and easily parsable for diagnosing issues.

# Test Strategy:
Create tests that verify the logging system captures all required information. Review log output for clarity and completeness in various scenarios including successful scheduling, unschedulable jobs, and error conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Logging Framework and Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a centralized logging framework with configurable levels and output formats
### Details:
Design a logging utility class that will be used throughout the codebase. Implement configuration options for log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR), output destinations (console, file), and formatting. Create helper methods for different types of logs (decision logs, warning logs, error logs). Define a consistent format for logs that includes timestamps, component identifiers, and message types. Ensure the logging system can be easily integrated with existing code components.

## 2. Implement Core Process Logging [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Add logging to capture key steps and decisions in the main orchestration process
### Details:
Integrate logging into the core scheduling algorithm to track major steps in the process. Log the start and completion of each scheduling pass, including the number of jobs processed and remaining. Add decision logs that explain why specific jobs were assigned to specific technicians, including factors that influenced the decision. Log scheduling constraints being applied and their impact. Ensure all major algorithm steps are traceable through logs for debugging purposes.

## 3. Implement Error and Warning Logging [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Add comprehensive error and warning logging throughout the system
### Details:
Implement error logging for all exception cases and error conditions. Add warning logs for non-critical issues that might affect scheduling quality but don't prevent execution. Log specific reasons why jobs couldn't be scheduled, including constraint violations or resource limitations. Implement logging for edge cases and unexpected conditions. Ensure all error logs include sufficient context for troubleshooting, such as job IDs, technician IDs, and relevant constraint values.

## 4. Implement Summary and Output Logging [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Create detailed summary logs and final output reporting
### Details:
Implement a final summary log generator that produces a comprehensive report at the end of the scheduling process. Include detailed technician schedules with timing, job details, and equipment. Generate Google Maps direction links for each technician's route and include them in the summary. Create a section for unscheduled jobs with specific reasons why they couldn't be scheduled. Format the summary log to be both human-readable and machine-parsable. Implement options to export the summary in different formats (text, JSON, CSV) for integration with other systems.
