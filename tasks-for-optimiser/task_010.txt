# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Integration Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive integration testing framework to validate the entire scheduling system against the requirements in the PRD.
# Details:
Create an integration testing framework that can simulate various scheduling scenarios and validate the system's behavior against the requirements in the PRD. Implement tests for key scenarios including: technicians with complex availability patterns, jobs with fixed time constraints, jobs requiring specific equipment, multi-day planning with overflow, and handling of unschedulable jobs. The framework should be able to set up test data, run the scheduling process, and verify the results against expected outcomes.

# Test Strategy:
Run the integration tests with various test data sets representing different real-world scenarios. Verify that the system correctly handles all constraints and produces optimal schedules. Compare the system's behavior before and after the refactoring to ensure all requirements are met.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Integration Testing Framework Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall architecture and components of the integration testing framework for the scheduling system
### Details:
Create a design document outlining: (1) Test data generation approach, (2) Test execution pipeline, (3) Result validation mechanisms, (4) Reporting structure, (5) Integration points with the scheduling system. The architecture should support parameterized tests and allow for simulation of various scheduling scenarios. Include class diagrams and component interaction flows. Consider using a fixture-based approach for test data setup and teardown.

## 2. Implement Test Data Generation Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a module to generate test data for different scheduling scenarios
### Details:
Develop a flexible test data generator that can create: (1) Technicians with configurable availability patterns, skills, and equipment, (2) Jobs with various time constraints, skill requirements, and equipment needs, (3) Equipment with different availability schedules, (4) Calendar configurations for multi-day planning. The generator should support both randomized data for stress testing and deterministic data for specific test cases. Include methods to persist test data and load predefined test scenarios from configuration files.

## 3. Build Test Execution Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop the core engine that executes integration tests by running the scheduling system with test data
### Details:
Implement a test execution engine that: (1) Sets up the scheduling system environment, (2) Injects test data from the generator, (3) Triggers the scheduling process with configurable parameters, (4) Captures the scheduling results and system state after execution, (5) Provides hooks for test verification. The engine should support both synchronous and asynchronous test execution and handle proper cleanup between test runs to ensure test isolation.

## 4. Implement Result Validation Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Create a framework to validate scheduling results against expected outcomes based on PRD requirements
### Details:
Develop validation components that can: (1) Verify technician assignments meet availability constraints, (2) Confirm job scheduling respects time constraints, (3) Check skill and equipment matching requirements, (4) Validate multi-day planning logic, (5) Verify handling of unschedulable jobs. The validation framework should provide detailed failure information when tests don't pass, including specific requirement violations and visual representations of the scheduling conflicts.

## 5. Implement Scenario-Based Test Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.4
### Description: Create a comprehensive set of test cases covering all key scheduling scenarios from the PRD
### Details:
Implement test cases for: (1) Technicians with complex availability patterns (part-time, shifts, time-offs), (2) Jobs with fixed time constraints (must-start-at, deadlines), (3) Jobs requiring specific equipment combinations, (4) Multi-day planning with work overflow, (5) Handling of unschedulable jobs and conflict resolution, (6) Edge cases like zero available technicians or maximum capacity scenarios. Each test case should clearly map to specific requirements in the PRD and include both positive and negative testing approaches.

## 6. Develop Test Reporting and Integration with CI/CD [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Create reporting mechanisms for test results and integrate the testing framework with CI/CD pipeline
### Details:
Implement: (1) Detailed test result reports showing pass/fail status with requirement traceability, (2) Visual reports of scheduling outcomes for failed tests, (3) Performance metrics collection for scheduling operations, (4) Integration with the CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically on code changes, (5) Regression test suite selection mechanism. Configure the framework to generate both human-readable reports and machine-parsable outputs (JSON/XML) for automated processing. Set up notifications for test failures with links to detailed reports.
