# Task ID: 15
# Title: Create comprehensive documentation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Document the E2E testing framework and its usage
# Details:
Create comprehensive documentation for the E2E testing framework:
1. README.md with overview, setup instructions, and usage examples
2. Documentation for each component:
   - Environment setup
   - Database management
   - Test execution
   - CLI runner
   - Migration utility
   - Technician data handling (including the separation into `technician-data.ts`)
   - The `--techs` parameter: purpose, usage flow, and examples in scenario seeding
3. Troubleshooting guide
4. Examples of extending the framework with new scenarios
5. Best practices for writing tests
6. Detailed explanation of recent refactoring:
   - Separation of technician definitions into `technician-data.ts`
   - Removal of technician handling from `seedBaseline`
   - Updated logic in `seedScenarioTechnicians`
   - Modified behavior of `cleanupScenarioLeftovers`
   - Updated scenario seeding architecture in `seed/index.ts`:
     - How it now handles technician seeding for scenarios
     - How it passes technicianDbIds down to specific scripts
     - How these IDs are included in the output metadata
     - Important note that scenario scripts must not seed technicians internally
7. Document recent scheduler refactoring in:
   - technical-reference.md
   - OVERVIEW.md
   - ARCHITECTURE.md
   Including details on:
     - DB availability changes
     - Gap modeling improvements
     - State tracking enhancements
8. Create new docs/guides/TESTING.md guide that provides comprehensive information on:
   - E2E testing framework
   - Integration testing approach
   - CLI runner usage and options
   - Seeding process details
   - Test execution flow

Ensure the documentation is clear, concise, and includes examples for all major operations.

# Test Strategy:
Review the documentation for completeness and accuracy. Have another team member follow the documentation to set up and use the framework, noting any unclear or missing information. Specifically verify:
1. The technician data handling documentation accurately reflects the recent refactoring
2. The documentation for the `--techs` parameter clearly explains its purpose and usage in scenario seeding
3. The documentation clearly explains the updated scenario seeding architecture in seed/index.ts
4. The scheduler refactoring documentation in technical-reference.md, OVERVIEW.md, and ARCHITECTURE.md accurately covers DB availability, gap modeling, and state tracking changes
5. The new TESTING.md guide provides clear and complete information on the E2E/integration testing framework, CLI runner, seeding process, and test execution flow

Ensure all documentation is consistent across files and accurately reflects the current implementation.
